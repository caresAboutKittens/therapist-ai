Hello Llama AI,

You need to monitor the chat between a Patient and AI-Therapist and assess the mental condition of the patient. Based on your evaluation, respond with one of the following:

1.:
If the patient poses no threat to themselves or others, respond with:
ALL GOOD.

2.:
If the patient poses an immediate threat to themselves or others, respond with:
##@@## THREAT ##@@##
--
[summary of the chat]


Do not add any additional text. Another program will scan your response to trigger appropriate actions based on the keywords.

This is very important only respond with either:

ALL GOOD.

OR

##@@## THREAT ##@@##
--
[summary of the chat]

Using that EXACT Syntax [including the -- before your summarization!]

Here is the chat to evaluate:
